## Makeing Hybrid Images 

# Note on MakeHybrid.m
In order to run the script, you first need to put the two images (dog and cat) into the Matlab workspace.  Name the two .bmp images 'cat' and 'dog' respectively.  Matlab should do this automatically for you when you drag and drop them into the workspace.  Once this is done, the script can be run.
