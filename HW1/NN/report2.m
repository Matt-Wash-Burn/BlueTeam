%% Delivery report Pt 2 
% This report contains the awnsers to questions posed in the Deliverable 

%% Deliverable 3ci

% The number of neurons that worked better for step 3  was 400 for a sample
% size of 9000. This number of neurons worked better because increasing the
% number of neurons showed a decrese in accuracy and favorable readings
% from the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic). This is most commanly
% because of overfitting to the training set of the data.  


%% Deliverable 3cii

%The extraction method that worked better was the one with less inputs and
%more information. The extraction of the frequency magnatude components
%showed an increased accuraccy at different levels of neurons in the sweep.
%This was because the features that were fed to the input had more
%information in them for the neural network. 

%% Part 3 Training a machine to understand emtion (The Sweep)

%Let it be known that the whole training dataset was not used in training 
%this neural network. It was modified to only take 15,000 training samples
%and use 9,000 of it to sweep for the number of hidden neurons.

%Below shows each sweep iteration from 100 to 1000, incrementing by 100
%each time. The fluctuation that we are seeing is due to
%the fact that the neural network is being trained with a different number
%of neurons each iteration. As can be seen, the accuracy per neurons
%decreases until it reaches 400 where it spikes to a 25% accuracy and then
%continues to decrease until the final iteration. This means that training
%the neural network with 400 neurons would give us the most accurate
%outputs. The final system accuracy is shown below also. As you can see,
%400 neurons is the most accurate in our sweep.

%We also manipulated the percentage of data going to training and testing

%overfitting more. However, the results yielded less accuracy as seen
%below.

%Each of the ROC curves shown below represent the performance of the neural
%network when being trained with the specified number of hidden neurons.
%Each emotion is represented by a class, as can be seen on each graph: 
%(7=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)
%What we are looking for is the ROC curve with the most classes
%located primarily in the upper left hand quadrant of the plot. This will
%indiacte that the neural networks performance, with respect to each
%class, is good.It can be seen that the plot utilizing 400 hidden neurons  
%shows the best ROC curve.
%The final ROC curve is the overall ROC curve for the neural network. 

%% Part 4 Methods to reduce complexity 
%Three different methods that could be used to reduce the complexity of the
%system are:
%1. wavelet: using wavelet transform would take out a lot of the noise in
%the images, allowing the neural network to grab better pixel values from
%the data sets.
%2. frequency domain: by taking the frequency domain, we could take lower
%values of an image and create a more precise data set for training and
%testing
%3. downsize image: downsizing an image would decrease the size of the
%dataset which could decrease the chance of overfitting the training set.
%This could reduce the complexity of the training set and increase the 
%accuracy. 

%All three of the above methods would manipulate the input images and
%create a more precise training and testing set for the neural network to
%be trained with. This would create a better performing and more accurate
%neural network.
