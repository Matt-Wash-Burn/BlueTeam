### Question 1

- After pulling all files from GitHub, move them into the MatLab default directory folder (usually in Documents->MATLAB) this will allow you to run all scripts without having to change any image filepaths. 
- If this is not working you need to right click on the current file tab (ex. 'HW1_Hybrid') and select "change current folder to...". Then in the directory view on the left side of the window right click on the data folder and select "add to path". 

#### a.1
- The two images (fish.bmp and motorcycle.bmp) should be in the same directory as the a.1 script. 
- Open the script 'HW1_Hybrid'  and click 'run' or press 'F5'. 
- The original images should appear as a figure in a pair. Followed by 2 hybrid images. The first is fish magnitude and motorcycle phase. The second is the motorcycle magnitude with the fish phase.   

#### a.2
- The three images (dog.bmp, fish.bmp and einstein.bmp) should be in the same directory as the a.2 script.
- Open the script 'HW1_1_a_ii' and click 'run' or press 'F5'. 
- Three figures should appear that contain a pair of images consisting of the original image and its nuetralized magnitude components.

#### a.3
- The three images (dog.bmp, fish.bmp and einstein.bmp) should be in the same directory as the a.3 script.
- Open the script 'HW1_1_a_iiI' and click 'run' or press 'F5'. 
- Three figures should appear that contain a pair of images consisting of the original image and its nuetralized phase components.

#### Delivery Report
- Contains the one page report, and the additions items (Timing Charts, and Run and Publish)
