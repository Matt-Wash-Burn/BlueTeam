- Open 'hw2.m'
 Change the 'filename' variable on line 12 in 'hw2.m' to wherever the 'fer2013.csv' file is located. 
 Run 'hw2.m' file first with 'fer2013.csv' file. 'Part1.mat' will be the saved preprocessed dataset.

- Next open 'NN_Q5C.m' and run it. 
 This will train a neural network for haar and for coif.
 ROC curves, Accuracy graphs, and Confusion matrices for each will be loaded and saved.
